    "The two plots above visualiza the data of number of challenges under a project. The challenges data scraped from TopCoder have two data field, `challenge_id` and `project_id`. The `challenge_id` is unique identifier of a challenge. The `project_id` is unique identifier of a project. The relationship of a project and a challenge is that, _one project can have multiple challenges under it._\n",

    "- Shown in histogram, the projects with no more than 60 challenges have a frequency of 243, the project with more than 60 challenges have a frequency of 26.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The majority of data points falls into range of less than 60. While the density of projects with 60 to 100 challenges is apprently large than the density of projects with more than 100 challenges.\n",

    "1. **Early adpater**: Projects with less than 60 challenges.\n",
    "2. **Entrance level**: Projects with number of challenges between 60 to 100.\n",
    "3. **Mature user**: Project with number of challenges over 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this aggregation, it could be worth of effort to look into the requirements/complexity analysis of challenges respectively on different tiers.\n",

    "- The difference of number of challenges every month in develop and design track fluctuates between 50 - 300 from 2014 to 2019.\n",
    "- Not until 2019 has the prize per challenge in develop track surpassed the design track in some of the months. Despite of less number of challenges and total prize, the prize per challenge in design trask has been constantly higher than develop track.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- The pricing pattern and complexity in Data Science should be picked out and analyze further to explore the reason why prize per challenge is so high. This may potentially indicate that the complexity in data science is gernerally higher than the other two tracks and hopefully it can link to the requirement's complexity learning. **This can be potentially done by doing a topic modeling with technology terms by challenges**.\n",
    "- Same thing in design vs develop track. Why the prize per challenge in design is almost always higher than develop track regardless of the fact that develop track challenges dominate the number of challenges posted every month."

We should go into the requirement details to figure pick out the challenges that have testing key word in it but tagged as other subtracks."

    "- It noteworthy that the prize per challenge fluctuation of F2F subtrack in the late 2017 to early 2019. One possibility is that **a project that purposely raise the prize to attract competitive worker and improve quality of result initiate challenges every other month**. Further verification awaits for the closer analysis of challenges.\n"
